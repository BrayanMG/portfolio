Welcome to my portfolio website!

If you didn't already know, my name is Brayan Mauricio Gonzalez. I grew in Raleigh, NC, which is where I currently live. Both my parents and I are from Mexico!

I studied math and computer science at Western Carolina University and graduated in May of 2023. Going to school in the mountains really connected me with nature.

Outside of work and school, I like to hike, play video games, and watch anime. Recently, I've been getting into tennis and pickleball!

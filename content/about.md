My name is Brayan Mauricio Gonzalez. I grew in Raleigh, NC, which is where I currently live. Both my parents and I are from Mexico!

I studied math and computer science at Western Carolina University and graduated in May of 2023. Going to school in the mountains was breathtaking.

Outside of work and school, I like to hike, play video games, and watch anime. Recently, I've been getting into tennis and pickleball!
